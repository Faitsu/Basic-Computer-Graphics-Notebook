# Basic-Computer-Graphics-Notebook

This code was made for my first assignment in my Graduate Info Visualization class using Python on a Google Collab notebook. The main objective of the code was to understand the concepts of Model-View-Projection, Rasteration, Z-Buffering, and Anti Aliasing and implement the concepts into code to display two intersecting triangles.
